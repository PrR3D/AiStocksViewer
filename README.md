# 📈 StockViewer App
This project is a desktop application developed in C# (.NET) as part of a personal research and educational effort.
Its main goal is to explore how an application can interact with AI-based services, process structured data, and present it in a user-friendly graphical interface.

The application allows users to search for stock symbols and view related market-style information, focusing on data handling, UI design, and visualization, rather than real-world financial usage.

## 🔹 The purpose of this project is to:

### 🎓 Practice C# (.NET) desktop application development

### 🤖 Experiment with AI integration in a real application scenario

### 🗃️ Visualize data using charts and tables

### 📐 And practice on Ui

# ⚠️ Important Notice

This application was developed exclusively for educational and research purposes.
The data displayed by the application should not be considered accurate, real-time, or reliable and must not be used for investment, trading, or financial decision-making.
